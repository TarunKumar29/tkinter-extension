Like the to use tkinter (for its simplicity) but worried about it not having enough widgets ?
If **yes**, then this package is for you.
If *no*, still the package is for you :joy:

It has all the widgets tkinter has ! (btw you need to have **tkinter** and **python** already installed as this package needs both)
